# Voice Captcha Solver

This project automates the solving of text-based captchas using voice input. It leverages Python libraries for speech recognition, image processing, and machine learning to decode distorted text and symbols used in captchas, which are commonly found on websites for security purposes.

## Features

- **Voice Input for Captchas**: Solve captchas by speaking the text aloud.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice input to text using advanced speech-to-text algorithms.
- **Image Processing**: Handles captcha image recognition and preprocessing to improve accuracy.
- **Automatic Submission**: Submits the decoded captcha solution to the website form.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition: For converting voice input into text
- pytesseract: For Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Pillow: For image manipulation
- requests: For handling HTTP requests
- pyautogui: For simulating mouse and keyboard actions

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pytesseract Pillow requests pyautogui
```
